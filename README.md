~~Please note: In the current release of NativeUI(1.9) backwards compatibility has been implemented regarding the affected function!
___ONLY VERSION 1.8 USERS MAY MAKE USE OF THIS!___~~

__Trying to port MapEditor to new NativeUI versions
by fixing the ``'GetScreenResolutionMaintainRatio()'`` method.__
This function has changed in the 1.8 release of NativeUI rendering
many Plugins maintained prior to that date [non functional](https://github.com/Guad/NativeUI/commit/b0ca33811ab95eded0e231bc4fe08e054fe14a28).
